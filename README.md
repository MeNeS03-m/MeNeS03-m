# 👋 Hi, I'm Przemek  
Informatics student at the University of Oslo, passionate about creating reliable systems, clean architecture, and meaningful digital solutions.

I enjoy solving real problems with code, improving performance, and building services that are easy to understand, maintain, and scale.

## 🌱 What I Work On
I focus on projects that strengthen my core skills in software engineering  
such as backend development, system design, networking, and security.

Recent areas of interest include:
- Building web applications that combine solid structure with a smooth user experience  
- Exploring cybersecurity topics, including networking 
- Working with APIs, distributed logic, and clean abstractions  
- Improving efficiency in code, both in time and space complexity

### 🔐 **Networking, Security, and Pentesting Labs**
Hands-on projects where I design and analyze network environments with a focus on security, resilience, and controlled attack simulation.  
I build isolated lab setups to study real-world traffic behavior, identify weaknesses, and apply defensive and offensive techniques in a safe environment.

My work includes:
- Creating segmented network topologies for testing attack paths and lateral movement  
- Deploying honeypots to observe scanning patterns and malicious behavior  
- Hardening Linux hosts through rule sets, service isolation, logging strategies, and least-privilege principles  
- Inspecting packets and protocols to understand how vulnerabilities are exploited in practice  
- Performing controlled tests such as port enumeration, service fingerprinting, and misconfiguration analysis  

I enjoy approaching problems like both a defender and an attacker, because it gives a deeper understanding of how systems fail and how to build them stronger. This reflects my interest in cybersecurity, network engineering, and the mindset needed to secure modern infrastructure.

**Other Experience**  
System configuration, agile teamwork, API integration with Meteorologisk institutt, collaborative app development

## 📈 What I Value
I value strong security, clear systems, and networks that stay reliable. I like understanding traffic, finding weak points, and fixing problems at the source. I think like both an engineer and an attacker to make systems more resilient.
